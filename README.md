# BAD BATTLESHIP GAME

Bad Battleship Game is python terminal game which i ran in code institute mock terminal in heroku. Was not shown how the javascript works on it so cant change it.

User have to first set all battleships on the board.Each battleship is diffrent size and direction for your board and computers.

## how to play

Game start of with you placing the ships.

Once placed you are shown your board and you can start shooting the enemy by writing a number from 00 to 99.

Missed shots are X and hit ships are O.

Once all ships sank for either you or computer the game is over.

Few exsisting features:

- Computer board is generated randomly
- ships are hidden
- can only play against computer
- Accepts user input

- Create better UI

## Data Model

Basic def, while, if, for, try and variable combo.

## Testing

Had to waste 3 days to get python to work on computer

17 days of nightmarish bugs and relearning and then repeating while being all alone whit no help.

2 many errors every last function was like hell other then the if,elif and else

None of the bugs i tried to fix were fixed

No code breaking bugs remain

### Validator testing

- PEP8
 - contained lots of trailing whitespace that did not show up on visualstudio 
## Deployment

This project was deployed on heroku whit code institute javascript and nodej.

- Fork orclone this repository
